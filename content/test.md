==========================

This page is written in markdown.

Here is some useful test routes that can be used to demonstrate and test how the routes work.

* [Say Hi](test/hi)
* [Say No! with a status code of 500](test/no)
* [Say Hi using JSON](test/json)

Here are som routes to try error handling.

* [exception](test/exception) throwing a general exception.
* [403](test/403) throwing a ForbiddenException.
* [404](test/404) throwing a NotFoundException.
* [500](test/500) throwing a InternalErrorException.
